**The OSI Model Explained with Real-World Examples**

The **Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model** is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement network communications. It consists of **seven layers**, each with distinct responsibilities. Below is an explanation of each layer with real-world examples:

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**  
   - **Function:** Deals with the transmission and reception of raw data bits over a physical medium (cables, fiber optics, wireless signals).  
   - **Example:** The **Ethernet cables** or **Wi-Fi signals** used to connect a computer to a network.

2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**  
   - **Function:** Provides node-to-node data transfer and error detection/correction.
   - **Example:** A **network switch** ensures that data packets are sent to the correct device based on **MAC addresses**.

3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**  
   - **Function:** Handles routing and addressing using IP addresses.
   - **Example:** A **router** directing data packets between networks using IP addresses (e.g., when accessing a website).

4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**  
   - **Function:** Ensures end-to-end communication, error handling, and data flow control.
   - **Example:** **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** ensures reliable delivery of emails or files without missing parts.

5. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**  
   - **Function:** Establishes, maintains, and terminates sessions between applications.
   - **Example:** **Video calls** on Zoom, where the session is maintained between two users.

6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**  
   - **Function:** Formats and encrypts/decrypts data to ensure proper delivery.
   - **Example:** **SSL/TLS encryption** in HTTPS ensures secure communication between a browser and a website.

7. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**  
   - **Function:** Provides network services to end-users.
   - **Example:** **Web browsers** (like Chrome or Firefox) use HTTP/HTTPS to retrieve and display web pages.
